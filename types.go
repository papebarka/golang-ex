/* Go is a statically typed programming language. What that means is the compiler
 * always wants to know what the type is for every value in the program. When the
 * compiler knows the type information ahead of time, it can help to make sure that
 * the program is working with values in a safe way. This helps to reduce potential
 * memory corruption and bugs, and provides the compiler the opportunity to produce
 * more performant code.
 */

 // User-defined types

 /*
  *
  * Go allows you the ability to declare your own types. When you declare a new type, the
  * declaration is constructed to provide the compiler with size and representation information,
  * similar to how the built-in types work. There are two ways to declare a userdefined
  * type in Go. The most common way is to use the keyword struct, which allows
  * you to create a composite type.
  */


/*
 * Struct types are declared by composing a fixed set of unique fields. Each field in a
 * struct is declared with a known type, which could be a built-in type or another userdefined
 * type.

	name			string

/*
 *
 * A second way to declare a user-defined type is by taking an existing type and using
 * it as the type specification for the new type. These types are great when you need a
 * new type that can be represented by an existing type. The standard library uses this
 * type declaration to create high-level functionality from the built-in types.
